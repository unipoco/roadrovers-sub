# Road Rovers Subtitles

The community maintained subtitles for the 1996 animated TV series "Road Rovers".

## About

This repository contains Advanced SubStation Alpha (.ass) subtitle files for "Road Rovers", a Warner Bros. animated series that aired from 1996 to 1997. The primary goal is to create complete, accurate English subtitles for all episodes and facilitate translations into other languages.

While Iâ€™ve done my best to provide accurate phrasing, English is not my first language, so there may be errors or misinterpretations. I welcome feedback and corrections from others to improve the quality of the subtitles. Thank you for your understanding and support!

## Structure

- `subtitles/english/`: Contains English subtitle files
- `subtitles/[language]/`: Contains subtitle files in other languages
- `docs/`: Style guides and documentation

## How to Use

### Downloading Subtitles

1. Navigate to the appropriate language folder in the `subtitles/` directory
2. Download the .ass file for the episode you want
3. Use with your preferred media player that supports .ass subtitle format (VLC, MPC-HC, etc.)
